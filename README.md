# godot-dynamic-subtitles
An addon for easily implementing subtitles using the built-in sound system.

This addon is currently in heavy development. The goal is to make a system that properly handles subtitles in a way that allows for jam games to be more accessible. I plan on using this addon in my future projects including a horror game inspired by Alien: Isolation. 

As more features are developed and solidified, I'll provide more proper documentation for use cases. However, the code has lots of comments so if you can figure out how it all works feel free to use it, hack it, whatever you desire!
